# Visual-Analytics-UK-Politics

A project to use visual analytics techniques to explore the Speech from the Throne datasets available from:
https://policyagendasuk.wordpress.com/datasets/

### Skills learnt/used during project:
1. Python wordclouds and NLP .
2. Using visual analytics to guide data analysis: iterating analysis through visual representations of data.

### Outcome:
Showed that the emphasis of the Speech from the Throne has changed: becoming more focused on policy than on public relations; and focusing more on Social Welfare, Law & Crime, and Civil Rights.
Interesting wordclouds created, but these aren't robust enough for a more complete NLP analysis of the data.
